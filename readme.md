# Welcome to Angry Snow Globe!

Diving into codepen.io was new and exciting for me. I wanted to create projects that started out fairly simple, building on my knowledge and level of difficulty as the creativity drove me to build. Angry Snow Globe is one of those projects that started with the simple idea of creating a snow globe, and ideas pile on as I grow and learn more about CSS. While this project is still ongoing, I wanted to create a GitHub repo to not only share my work, but also to encourage creativity through CSS and front-end design.

### Coming Soon

- Better arm knocking animation that appears more realistic.
- More color and features to make the CSS pop.
- Will begin to incorporate JS down the line to make the animation interactive to the user.

### Front-End

In order to really perfect my front-end skills, I have started building my codepen.io profile in order to practice the deeper arts of CSS. While only using HTML and CSS, I have been able to focus on the creativity of animation, and learning precious knowledge of the art through building.


## Challenges & Learning

While taking a deep dive into something that I have used before, but only on the most basic level was interesting to me. It was awesome to build on my knowledge and add to the fun of creating.

### Challenges

- Animation was something that I hadn't really used before, so watching videos and trial and error have become my greatest help on this project.
- Acting almost as an artist/graphic designer with just CSS and HTML was a huge leap for me, but it has become so much fun.
- Bringing in a new methodology, BEM, for CSS added to the learning curve, but has increased the readability of the project.

### Learnings

- There is so much fun to take from animation in CSS. While is can be difficult to get exactly what you want in the beginning, you can almost create anything once you master it.
- Research continues to be the forefront of my success in any project, and that has only become even more true for this project.
- Becoming an artist through CSS takes time, but as long as I am having fun and learning, I have nothing to lose.
